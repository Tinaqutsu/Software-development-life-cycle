# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1. What is SDLC?
- SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
- It is a systematic process of developing software, encompassing planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining the software.

## 2. The Seven Important Phases of SDLC:
1. **Planning:**
   - Identifying project scope, objectives, timeline, and resources.
  
2. **Feasibility Study:**
   - Assessing the project's viability, considering technical, operational, and economic factors.

3. **Design:**
   - Creating the overall architecture and design specifications for the software.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Writing code and converting design specifications into actual software.

5. **Testing:**
   - Evaluating the software to identify and fix defects and ensure it meets requirements.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Releasing the software to users and integrating it into the existing system.

7. **Maintenance:**
   - Post-deployment activities, including updates, bug fixes, and improvements.

## 3. SDLC Models:
- Different approaches to organizing and executing the software development process.
- Examples include Waterfall, Agile, Iterative, and Spiral models.

## 4. More about SDLC Models:
- Each model has its own set of principles, advantages, and disadvantages.
- The choice of model depends on project requirements and constraints.

## 5. Various Components of Software and Correct Terminology:
- **Code:** Instructions written by developers.
- **Database:** Stores data for the application.
- **Algorithm:** Step-by-step instructions for solving a particular problem.
- **User Interface (UI):** The visual and interactive part of the software.

## 6. Different Types of Software Development Process Models:
- Waterfall Model, Agile Model, Spiral Model, Iterative Model, etc.

## 7. Steps of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
- Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing.

## 8. Software Prototyping:
- A development approach where a prototype (an early approximation of a final system) is built, tested, and then reworked until an acceptable prototype is achieved.

## 9. Quick Summary on Software Prototyping:
- Prototyping helps in better understanding user requirements.
- It allows for early user feedback, reducing the risk of misunderstandings.
- Iterative prototyping refines the software progressively.
